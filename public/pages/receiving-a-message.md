Receiving a message
---

Incoming chat messages will be received on the `/service/stream` channel if youâ€™re subscribed. The chat messages are formatted as JSON objects with the following format. Note that the senderType is 'Human,' whereas messages sent by the API must be of type 'API.'

```
{
  "messageType": "Message",
  "contentData": "[incoming chat message here]",
  "senderType": "Human"
}
```
  
An example of this interaction can be found in our Hubot adapter [here](https://github.com/sococo/hubot-sococo/blob/master/source/sococo.coffee#L126-L149).

You will receive messages as long as you are connected and subscribed to the `/service/stream` channel. Note that the API client will show up as a 'robot' avatar in the room you are authenticated into. In this way, we allow the API client's presence to be transparent to the users who are present in the room.
