Authentication
---

To authenticate using the Sococo streaming API, you need to POST an api token and room code to /api/v1/login.

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>
				Variable
			</th>
			<th>
				Description
			</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				room
			</td>
			<td>
				This code represents the room you’d like to authenticate into. You can find this code by right clicking on any room in Sococo and clicking “Copy Room Link” or clicking on “Edit Room”<br /><br />

				Example Copied Link: <br />
				https://www.sococo.com/web/join/1a6b6dce4sw07a2c42d1fuuo7<br /><br />

				Example Room Code from Link:<br />
				1a6b6dce4sw07a2c42d1fuuo7
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				token
			</td>
			<td>
				This is the token generated by you from the portion of this guide entitled [“Generating an API Token”](/pages/issue-api-token.html)
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

To form an authentication request, you will issue a POST to https://as-vip.sococo.com/api/v1/login

The body of the request will need to be JSON encoded and contain the API Token and Room Code. The response will contain two cookie values “API-Cookie” and “API-Route.” These will need to be saved for establishing your streaming connection.

**Example POST**:
```
{
	“token”: “[YOUR API TOKEN HERE]”,
	“room”: “[YOUR ROOM CODE HERE]”
}
```

**Example Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK.
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1.
Set-Cookie: API-Cookie="[value from server]"; Version=[value from server].
Set-Cookie: API-Route=[value from server]; Version=[value from server].
