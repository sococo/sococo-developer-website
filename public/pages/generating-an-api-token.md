Generating an API token
---

To generate an API token, navigate over to the Administrative Console for [your account](https://www.sococo.com/console#user). There you’ll find a section dedicated to generating a token called “Developer.”
  
When you click on ”Create Token,” it should generate a 36 character long token for you. Keep this a secret as it will allow access to any room for which your account has access.
  
Some people generate a Sococo account specific for their API access so they can quickly change access rights without affecting their user account. Feel free to do the same!
